# Boatsetter Outbound Engine

A Python + Streamlit outreach engine for Boatsetter's supply team. Reads boat owner data from Google Sheets (sourced from Snowflake), segments it, sends personalized email and SMS via the Kustomer API, and writes results back to the sheet. Replaces a fragile n8n workflow.

**Live app:** https://supply-outbound-engine.streamlit.app

## Architecture Overview

```
Snowflake export
      ↓
Google Sheets (one sheet per market, multiple tabs)
      ↓
Prep pipeline (split → classify → detect cross-list)
      ↓
engine.py  ←  segmentation.py (filter eligible rows + assign touch #)
      ↓             ↓
templates.py    round_robin.py (assign rep)
      ↓
Kustomer API (create customer → create conversation → send email/SMS)
      ↓
Google Sheets (write timestamps, Kustomer ID, conversation link)
      ↓
metrics.py (reads all sheets → aggregates T1/T2/T3 × email/SMS per market)
```

**Streamlit app (`app.py`)** wraps the entire pipeline in a web UI with five tabs: Setup · Prep · Outreach · Messaging · Metrics. The app runs on Streamlit Cloud and reads secrets from the Streamlit secrets manager (locally it falls back to `.env`).

---

## How to Run

### Local development

```bash
cd "/Users/fernandogarcia/Desktop/Claude/Outbound Engine"
source outbound_engine/venv/bin/activate
streamlit run app.py
# Opens at http://localhost:8501
```

### Deployed app

Lives at https://supply-outbound-engine.streamlit.app. Deploys automatically from the `main` branch of the GitHub repo. Secrets (API keys + GCP service account) are stored in Streamlit Cloud's secrets manager — never in code.

**Login gate:** The app is publicly viewable but all action buttons are disabled until the user logs in. Credentials live in Streamlit secrets under `[auth]` (`username` + `password`). To update credentials, edit the secret on share.streamlit.io and reboot the app. Local dev bypasses the login entirely.

### CLI (alternative to web app)

```bash
python controller.py prep     --market savannah [--dry-run]
python controller.py outreach --market savannah --phase 1 [--dry-run] [--yes] [--test]
python controller.py outreach --market savannah --phase 2 [--dry-run] [--yes] [--test]
python controller.py outreach --market savannah --phase 3 [--dry-run] [--yes] [--test]
```

`--market` accepts partial names (`savannah` matches "Savannah - Outbound").

---

## Markets & Auto-Discovery

Markets are discovered automatically from a Google Drive folder at app startup (cached 5 min).

**Drive folder:** `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1jje4PAk8chx9pSbkjldhWsAqFQiCA4cf`

### Adding a new market

1. Create a Google Sheet named `<Location> - Outbound` (e.g. "Tampa Bay - Outbound")
2. Add tabs: `BS - Live` | `GMB - Live` | `BS - Not Live` | `BS - Churn` | `GMB - Not Live` | `Prospects`
   - `Sheet1` is the raw import staging tab — Funnel Prep reads from it and writes to all others
3. Share with `outbound-engine@n8n-sheets-456321.iam.gserviceaccount.com` (Editor)
4. Place the sheet (or a shortcut) in the Drive folder above
5. It appears in the app dropdown within 5 minutes

### Naming convention

Whatever comes before `- Outbound` is used verbatim as the market name in message copy.

| Sheet name | Copy says |
|---|---|
| `Savannah - Outbound` | Savannah |
| `Tampa Bay - Outbound` | Tampa Bay |
| `Houston and nearby - Outbound` | Houston and nearby |

---

## Outreach Phases & Touch Sequence

### Three phases, run in order

| Phase | Segment(s) | Source tab(s) | Channel |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Phase 1 — Cross-List** | `cross_list` | BS - Live → Getmyboat pitch | Email + SMS |
| | | GMB - Live → Boatsetter pitch | SMS only |
| **Phase 2 — Reactivate + Get Live** | `reactivate`, `get_live` | BS - Not Live | Email + SMS |
| **Phase 3 — Prospect** | `prospect` | Prospects | Email + SMS |

### Three-touch sequence per contact

Each phase runs a 3-touch sequence. The engine determines which touch each contact is ready for based on timestamps in the sheet.

| Touch | Label | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Touch 1 | Initial | `Contact Status = Pending Outreach`, no prior sends |
| Touch 2 | Follow-up 1 | `Contact Status = Contacted`, T1 timestamp exists, no T2 yet, no reply |
| Touch 3 | Follow-up 2 | `Contact Status = Contacted`, T2 timestamp exists, no T3 yet, no reply |

There is no minimum time gap between touches — run follow-ups whenever you're ready. The web app shows three rows (Initial / Follow-up 1 / Follow-up 2) per phase with separate Dry Run and Send buttons. All call the same `run_campaign()` — the engine selects the right touch per contact automatically.

A contact is skipped entirely if `Replied? = true`.

---

## Prep Pipeline

The Prep tab has two independent sections:

### Funnel Prep — run once per new Snowflake export, before Phases 1 + 2

Paste the full Snowflake export (all platforms, all listing states) into `Sheet1`, then click **Run Prep**. Four steps run in sequence:

#### Step 1 — Import & Split (`import_split.py`)

Reads `Sheet1` and routes every row to the correct destination tab based on `platform` and `IS_CURRENTLY_LIVE_ON_SITE`. Clears each destination tab before writing.

| Destination | platform | IS_CURRENTLY_LIVE_ON_SITE | BOAT_LISTING_STATE |
|---|---|---|---|
| BS - Live | `marketplace` | 1 | any |
| GMB - Live | `gmb` | 1 | any |
| BS - Not Live | `marketplace` | 0 | approved · corrections_needed · pending_review · survey_received |
| BS - Churn | `marketplace` | 0 | blocked · boatbound_denied · deactivated · deleted · incomplete · insurance_denied · pending_insurance · pending_survey |
| GMB - Not Live | `gmb` | 0 | any |

#### Step 2 — Classify (`classify_not_live.py`)

Assigns `Tier`, `Action to take`, and `Contact Status` to rows in `BS - Not Live`.

| Tier | BOAT_LISTING_STATE | Condition | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | `approved` | No LAST_LIVE date | Get Live |
| Tier 1 | `approved` | Has LAST_LIVE date | Reactivate |
| Tier 2 | `pending_review`, `survey_received` | Created ≥ 2023-01-01 | Get Live |
| Tier 3 | `pending_review`, `survey_received` | Created < 2023-01-01 | Get Live |
| Rehab | `corrections_needed` | — | Check (no outreach) |

#### Step 3 — Cross-List Detection (`cross_list.py`)

Runs 6-layer detection across `BS - Live` and `GMB - Live`. Adds outreach tracking columns and color-coded dropdowns to both tabs.

See [Cross-List Detection](#cross-list-detection) for full detail.

#### Step 4 — Churn Classification (`prep_churn.py`)

Adds tracking columns and dropdowns to `BS - Churn`, then classifies `deactivated` rows by tier. All other churn states are left unclassified.

| Tier | Condition |
|---|---|
| Tier 1 | `deactivated` + LAST_LIVE_AT not empty + year > 2024 |
| Tier 2 | `deactivated` + LAST_LIVE_AT empty or year ≤ 2024 |
| — (unclassified) | Any other churn state |

Tier 1 rows are the most actionable — recently deactivated owners with known activity. Focus here when building Phase 4 churn outreach.

---

### Prospects Prep — run before Phase 3, safe to run after Phases 1 + 2 are done

`prep_prospects.py` — only touches the `Prospects` tab. One click runs two steps:

#### Step 1 — Column setup

Ensures tracking columns exist (`Funnel Status`, `Action to take`, `Contact Status`, `Replied?`, `Draft Subject`, `Draft Email`, `Draft SMS`, `Email 1/2/3`, `SMS 1/2/3`, `Kustomer ID`, link, `Notes`). Sets `Action to take = "Prospect"` and `Contact Status = "Pending Outreach"` for new rows only. Applies color-coded dropdowns.

#### Step 2 — Funnel detection

Cross-checks every prospect against all funnel tabs and Kustomer. Writes a `Funnel Status` per row and flips matched rows to `Manual Check` so they aren't auto-contacted.

| Layer | Checks | Funnel Status written |
|---|---|---|
| L1+2 | BS - Live email + phone | `BS Active` |
| L3+4 | GMB - Live email + phone | `GMB Active` |
| L5+6 | BS - Not Live email + phone | `BS Funnel` (+ listing state in Notes) |
| L7+8 | BS - Churn email + phone | `BS Funnel` (+ listing state in Notes) |
| L9 | Kustomer API lookup | `In Kustomer` |
| — | No match | `Net New` |

**Net New** rows → Action stays `Prospect`, ready for outreach.
**Matched** rows → Action flipped to `Manual Check`, review before contacting.
**Skip** rows → never overwritten regardless of detection result.

---

### Phase 3 Outreach — 4-step flow

```
Step 1 — Generate Drafts → Step 2 — Send Initial → Step 3 — Follow-up 1 → Step 4 — Follow-up 2
```

**Step 1 — Generate Drafts** (`draft_prospects.py`) — generates T1 drafts only. Writes `Draft Subject`, `Draft Email`, `Draft SMS`, and `Draft Assignee ID` to the Prospects tab. Nothing is sent.

**Step 2 — Send Initial** (`engine.send_from_drafts()`) — sends exactly what is in the draft columns. Rep assignment comes from `Draft Assignee ID` so body copy and Kustomer assignment always match. Writes timestamps to `Email 1` / `SMS 1`. Kustomer conversation title is set to the `Draft Subject` value.

**Step 3 — Follow-up 1** (`engine.run_campaign(min_touch=2, max_touch=2)`) — sends T2 directly from templates. Replies on the same Kustomer conversation as T1. Email subject falls back to `Draft Subject` column. Same rep as T1.

**Step 4 — Follow-up 2** (`engine.run_campaign(min_touch=3, max_touch=3)`) — sends T3 directly from templates. Same threading and rep behaviour as Follow-up 1.

---

## Segmentation Logic

`segmentation.py` — `filter_eligible_rows()` returns `(row, touch_number)` pairs.

A row is eligible if:
- Has email or phone
- `Replied?` ≠ `true`
- `Action to take` matches the segment's expected value (from `SEGMENT_ACTIONS` in config)
- Touch timing rules are met (see three-touch table above)

**Deduplication:** Multiple rows for the same owner (matched by email, fallback phone) are collapsed into one. The `_boat_count` field is set so templates can use "your boat" / "your boats" / "your fleet".

---

## Message Templates

All copy lives in `templates.py`. `get_messages()` is the single entry point — returns `{sms_body, email_body, email_subject}`.

### Per-market overrides (✏️ Messaging tab)

The web app has a **Messaging** tab where you can edit and save custom copy per market. Overrides are stored in a `_templates` tab in each market's Google Sheet (auto-created on first save). The engine loads overrides at campaign start and applies them field-by-field — if only SMS is overridden, email falls back to the default.

Supported placeholders in override text:

| Placeholder | Resolves to |
|---|---|
| `{greeting}` | "Hi John," or "Hi there," |
| `{market}` | Market name (e.g. "Savannah") |
| `{rep}` | Rep name or "Casey" for prospects |
| `{boat_noun}` | "your boat" / "your boats" / "your fleet" |
| `{charter_name}` | Business name (prospect templates) |
| `{activities}` | Top 3 activities joined naturally: "inshore, offshore, and shark fishing" |
| `{boat_type}` | Specific vessel noun if available: "catamaran", "skiff", "pontoon" — empty for generic types |
| `{name_ref}` | "I came across X" or "I came across your operation" |
| `{activity_ref}` | ", including fishing trips," or "" |

If no override exists for a market, the hardcoded defaults in `templates.py` are used — zero behavior change.

### Signing

All segments — including prospects — are signed with **real rep names (Tyler or Fernando)**, round-robin. There is no "Casey" alias.

Rep is assigned at draft generation time (prospects: saved in `Draft Assignee ID`) or at send time (funnel: saved in `Assigned Rep ID`). The same rep is reused for T2/T3 so the name never changes across the thread.

### Variants

**Reactivate:** `recent` (< 90 days inactive) or `old` (≥ 90 days / no date)

**Cross-list:** `bs` (sheet starts with "BS" → rep from Boatsetter, pitching Getmyboat) or `gmb` (sheet starts with "GMB" → rep from Getmyboat, pitching Boatsetter)

**Prospect:** auto-detected from `Type` column
| Variant | Trigger |
|---|---|
| `fishing` | Type contains "fishing" |
| `charter` | Everything else (rental, tours, eco, sunset, watersports, yacht) |

Rental is merged into charter — both get booking-focused copy framed around filling open days.

### Location personalization

`_location(row, market)` resolves the most specific city available:
- Prospects: reads `Location` column
- Funnel rows: reads `BOAT_CITY` column
- Strips trailing state abbreviation: "Savannah, GA" → "Savannah"
- Strips marina suffix before state: "Savannah, GA — Savannah Marina" → "Savannah"
- Falls back to market DMA name if both columns are empty
- `_in_loc(name, location)` skips `" in {location}"` when the city is already in the business name (avoids "Tybee Island Watersports in Tybee Island")

### Prospect data columns used for personalization

- `Charter Name` — business name in opener
- `Owner Name` — split on first space for greeting ("Hi Judy,"); falls back to "Hi there,"
- `Activities/Events/Services` — top 3 formatted naturally ("inshore, offshore, and shark fishing")
- `Boat Type` — injected as a specific noun when meaningful ("your catamaran", "your skiff"); skipped for generic values like "multi-vessel fleet" or "center console"
- `Booking Software` — if a known platform (FareHarbor, Bookeo, Rezdy, etc.), adds one sentence positioning Boatsetter as an additive channel
- `Location` — city for prospect rows (see location personalization above)

### Copy rules

- No em dashes anywhere — use commas or restructure; em dashes signal AI-generated content
- Market name auto-injected from sheet name (strips `- Outbound` suffix)
- Greeting auto-built from `Owner Name` (prospect) or `OWNER_FIRST_NAME` (other segments); falls back to "Hi there,"
- T2/T3 follow-up subjects are empty — they reply on an existing thread, subject is irrelevant

---

## Kustomer Integration

**Three API keys:**
- `KUSTOMER_API_KEY_READ` — lookups only
- `KUSTOMER_API_KEY_WRITE` — create conversations + send messages
- `KUSTOMER_API_KEY_CREATE` — create new customers (falls back to write key if not set)

The write key's permission scope covers conversations and messaging but not customer creation. `KUSTOMER_API_KEY_CREATE` is required for Phase 3 initial outreach where prospects don't yet exist in Kustomer. Follow-up touches (T2/T3) reuse the stored Kustomer ID and never call the create endpoint.

### Send flow per contact

1. **Resolve Kustomer ID** — lookup by email → lookup by phone → create new customer (stored in `Kustomer ID` column)
2. **T1: Create conversation** — assigned to rep + supply team (`assignedTeams: ["69b1d655010fbbf86a5557d6"]`); conversation URL stored in `KUSTOMER_CONVERSATION_ID`
3. **T2/T3: Reuse conversation** — conversation ID parsed from the stored `KUSTOMER_CONVERSATION_ID` URL (`_parse_conversation_id()` splits on `/event/`)
4. **Send email** — `POST /v1/customers/{id}/drafts` with `channel: "email"`
5. **Send SMS** — same endpoint with `channel: "sms"`
6. **Write back to sheet** — timestamps, conversation link, rep ID

Email and SMS are sent in independent try/except blocks so one failure doesn't block the other.

**Email from:** `{"email": "supplyteam@boatsetter.com", "name": "Boatsetter Supply Team"}`
**SMS from:** `+18554310490` (configurable via `KUSTOMER_SMS_FROM` env var)
**Phone normalization:** `_normalize_phone()` in `kustomer_client.py` converts 10-digit US numbers to `+1XXXXXXXXXX`. Applied at customer lookup, customer creation, and SMS send — raw numbers from the sheet (e.g. `9123736602`) are handled correctly throughout.

### Conversation tags

Auto-generated per run: `outbound_engine` + `supply_acq_<market_snake_case>`

---

## Google Sheets Integration

`sheets_connector.py` wraps gspread with a service account.

**Important:** Phone numbers from `get_all_records()` come back as integers — always `str()` cast before use. `append_row()` uses `value_input_option="RAW"` to prevent Sheets from interpreting `+` prefixes as formula operators.

**Rate limiting:** `SheetsConnector` uses `BackOffHTTPClient` (gspread 6.x), which auto-retries on 429s with exponential backoff. No manual retry logic needed.

**Fleet owners:** `update_row` matches by `OWNER_EMAIL` (fallback `OWNER_PHONE_NUMBER`) and updates every row sharing that owner in a single batch call — timestamps, Contact Status, and Kustomer link stay in sync across all of an owner's boats automatically.

### Columns written during outreach

| Column | Written when |
|---|---|
| `Kustomer ID` | First send (if not already in sheet) |
| `Contact Status` | Set to `Contacted` on Touch 1 |
| `Email 1` / `SMS 1` | Timestamp of Touch 1 send |
| `Email 2` / `SMS 2` | Timestamp of Touch 2 send |
| `Email 3` / `SMS 3` | Timestamp of Touch 3 send |
| `KUSTOMER_CONVERSATION_ID` | Link to conversation in Kustomer |

Row matching: by `OWNER_EMAIL` first, fallback to `OWNER_PHONE_NUMBER`.
Timestamp format written to sheet: `YYYY-MM-DD`.

---

## Test Mode

Toggle "Test contacts only" in the sidebar. In test mode:
- Only rows where `Notes = "test"` are processed
- Eligibility and touch-timing checks are **bypassed** — test contacts always get Touch 1
- Lets you rerun test outreach without resetting the sheet

### Seeding test rows

With test mode on, go to the Outreach tab → Test Setup. Use the multiselect to choose which team members to seed (defaults to all), then click **Seed test rows**. Idempotent — skips any tab where a contact already exists.

| Tab | Tyler's row | Fernando's row |
|---|---|---|
| BS - Live | Cross-List · Pending Outreach | Cross-List · Pending Outreach |
| GMB - Live | Cross-List · Pending Outreach | Cross-List · Pending Outreach |
| BS - Not Live | Reactivate · Pending Outreach | Get Live · Pending Outreach |
| Prospects | Prospect | Prospect |

Action assignments (Reactivate / Get Live) are fixed per person regardless of who is selected. Kustomer ID is left blank when seeded — the engine fills it at send time via `get_or_create_customer()`.

**Testing individually:** Select only your own name in the multiselect, or manually clear the `Notes = "test"` value from someone else's row in the sheet — the engine skips any row where Notes ≠ "test".

### Confirmation gate

Live sends (non-dry-run) require a second "Confirm — Send" click after the initial send button. Dry runs skip this.

---

## Cross-List Detection

`cross_list.py` — runs during Prep Step 3. Scans `BS - Live` and `GMB - Live` against all other tabs.

| Layer | Match type | Result written |
|---|---|---|
| L1 | Email vs BS - Live | `Dual Presence` |
| L2 | Phone vs BS - Live | `Dual Presence` |
| L3 | Email/phone vs BS - Churn | `Already on BS Funnel` + state + admin URL |
| L4 | Email/phone vs BS - Not Live | `Already on BS Funnel` + state |
| L5 | Kustomer lookup | `Possible Dual Presence` or `Cross-List` |
| L6 | Name match vs BS - Churn / BS - Not Live | `Already on BS Funnel` (name match, verify before outreach) |

### Dropdowns added to BS - Live and GMB - Live during Prep

**Action to take:** Cross-List (blue) · Skip (gray) · Manual Check (peach)

**Contact Status (BS - Live):** Pending Outreach · Contacted · Interested · Cross-List WIP · Not Interested · Win · Dual Presence (gray) · Possible Dual Presence (orange)

**Contact Status (GMB - Live):** same as BS - Live + Already on BS Funnel (salmon)

---

## BS - Not Live Classification

Handled by `classify_not_live.py` during Prep Step 2.

| Tier | BOAT_LISTING_STATE | Condition | Action assigned |
|---|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | `approved` | `LAST_LIVE` empty | Get Live |
| Tier 1 | `approved` | `LAST_LIVE` not empty | Reactivate |
| Tier 2 | `pending_review`, `survey_received` | Created ≥ 2023-01-01 | Get Live |
| Tier 3 | `pending_review`, `survey_received` | Created < 2023-01-01 | Get Live |
| Rehab | `corrections_needed` | — | Check (no outreach sent) |

The `Reactivate` action uses a `recent` message variant when `BOAT_LISTING_LAST_LIVE_ON_SITE_AT` is within 90 days.

---

## Metrics Dashboard

The **📊 Metrics** tab (5th tab in the web app) aggregates outreach performance across all markets. Data is read directly from the sheets, cached for 30 minutes, with a manual Refresh button.

### What it shows

Three sections:

- **Overall** — combined summary cards: Owners Contacted, Reply Rate, Emails Sent, SMS Sent, Total Messages
- **Funnel Outreach** — BS - Live, GMB - Live, BS - Not Live tabs; existing owners with a prior BS/GMB relationship
- **Prospect Outreach** — Prospects tab only; cold outreach to net new contacts

Each section shows summary cards and a per-market table (Owners Contacted, Emails, SMS, Total Messages, Replied, Reply Rate). A market only appears in a section if it has sends in that category — markets with both funnel and prospect data appear in both sections.

### How it works

- **Tab classification** — tabs whose name contains `"prospect"` (case-insensitive) count as prospect outreach; everything else with touch columns counts as funnel
- Reads `Email 1` / `SMS 1` / `Email 2` / `SMS 2` / `Email 3` / `SMS 3` columns; also handles `SMS1` (no space) for legacy n8n-era sheets
- Deduplicates by owner email/phone — fleet owners count once regardless of boat count
- Filters out test rows (`Notes = "test"`)

**Reply Rate** requires manually toggling `Replied?` to `TRUE` in the sheet when an owner responds in Kustomer. Everything else updates automatically.

---

## Configuration

`config.py` — central config file. Key settings:

```python
REACTIVATE_RECENT_DAYS = 90    # days threshold for "recent" reactivate variant

TEAM_MEMBERS = [
    {"name": "Tyler",    "kustomer_id": "...", "email": "tbrick@boatsetter.com",   "phone": "+16128503633"},
    {"name": "Fernando", "kustomer_id": "...", "email": "fernando@boatsetter.com", "phone": "+528116892533"},
]
```

**`REACTIVATE_RECENT_DAYS`** — contacts whose listing was last live within this many days get the "recently inactive" reactivate message variant (higher urgency). Default: 90.

**To add a team member:** append to `TEAM_MEMBERS` with their `name`, `kustomer_id`, `email`, and `phone`.

**Prospect sheet column overrides** — prospect sheets use different column names than Snowflake-sourced sheets. Mapped in `SEGMENT_COLUMN_OVERRIDES`:
- `Email` → `OWNER_EMAIL`
- `Phone Number` → `OWNER_PHONE_NUMBER`
- `Owner Name` → `OWNER_FIRST_NAME` (engine splits on first space to get last name)

### Environment variables (`.env` / Streamlit secrets)

| Variable | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `KUSTOMER_API_KEY_READ` | Read-only Kustomer key (lookups) |
| `KUSTOMER_API_KEY_WRITE` | Write Kustomer key (conversations + send messages) |
| `KUSTOMER_API_KEY_CREATE` | Customer creation key (required for Phase 3 initial; falls back to write key if unset) |
| `GOOGLE_SHEETS_CREDENTIALS_JSON` | Path to GCP service account JSON |
| `MARKETS_DRIVE_FOLDER_ID` | Google Drive folder ID for market discovery |
| `KUSTOMER_EMAIL_FROM_ADDRESS` | Outbound email address |
| `KUSTOMER_EMAIL_FROM_NAME` | Outbound email display name |
| `KUSTOMER_SMS_FROM` | Outbound SMS number (E.164) |

- **Fleet owner deduplication** — one message per owner, all matching rows updated in one batch call ✅
- **Rate limiting** — BackOffHTTPClient auto-retries on 429s; no mid-run crashes ✅
- **Skip option** on all tabs — set Action to "Skip" to exclude any row from all outreach ✅
- **Per-market message template overrides** — Messaging tab, stored in `_templates` Sheet tab ✅
- **Metrics dashboard** — 5th tab, three sections: Overall (combined) + Funnel Outreach + Prospect Outreach; per-market tables in each; 30-min cache; legacy `SMS1` column support for Keys n8n data ✅
- Test mode with per-person seed selection (idempotent, reports existing row number) ✅
- Round-robin rep assignment, persisted in `round_robin_state.json` ✅
- Confirmation gate before live sends ✅
- Independent email/SMS error handling ✅
- **Rep consistency across all touches** — same rep (Tyler or Fernando) used for T1/T2/T3; stored in `Draft Assignee ID` (prospects) and `Assigned Rep ID` (funnel) ✅
- **Prospect templates** — real rep names, fishing/charter variants, city-level location, activities/boat type/booking software personalization, no em dashes ✅
- **Phase 3 4-step flow** ✅ — Generate Drafts → Send Initial → Follow-up 1 → Follow-up 2; each step targets exactly one touch
- **Phase 1+2 step flow** ✅ — separate Initial / Follow-up 1 / Follow-up 2 buttons per phase; each targets exactly one touch (min_touch=max_touch)
- **Follow-up conversation threading** ✅ — T2/T3 reply on the same Kustomer thread as T1 (confirmed working); email subject reused from `Draft Subject` for prospects
- **Cross-list email subjects** ✅ — BS variant: "Get more bookings by listing on Getmyboat too"; GMB variant: "Get more bookings by listing on Boatsetter too"
- **Timestamp date format** ✅ — `Email 1/2/3` and `SMS 1/2/3` columns formatted as `yyyy-mm-dd` during prep; `update_row` uses `USER_ENTERED` so Sheets stores proper date values (no formula-bar apostrophe)
- **Three Kustomer API keys** ✅ — read (lookups) / write (conversations + send) / create (new customers); create key falls back to write key if unset

### Not Yet Built / Known Issues

- **Prospect scraping automation** — currently manual via `/boat-charter-prospector` skill in Claude Code
- **Prospects Prep re-run idempotency** — re-running overwrites matched rows even if manually reviewed; future fix: skip rows that already have a `Funnel Status`
- **BS - Churn outreach (Phase 4)** — prep is done; Tier 1 deactivated rows are classified and ready; outreach copy + engine segment not yet built
- **GMB - Not Live outreach** — tab is populated by Funnel Prep; no outreach process or copy yet
